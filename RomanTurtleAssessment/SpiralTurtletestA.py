#--------------------------------------------------
# Problem with above code
# In the original code, the smallturtle() function was defined but never called, and the turtle.done() statement was placed outside of the function. Also, the commented out mycircles1() function is not needed for this particular code.

# Solution
# To fix these issues, I moved the turtle.done() statement inside the smallturtle() function, and added a call to smallturtle() before it. This ensures that the function is executed and the circles are drawn before the program exits.
