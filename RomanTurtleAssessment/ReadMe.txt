# At the start of the Turtle program a Canvas will appear and pause for 20 seconds (which I have disabled, to value (0) for the Assessment).  My reason for a 20sec pause was experimenting with Presenter scenarios.

# Then a Canvas Grid will be created and Text Title print to screen.  During this process a user can hit the space bar to use an assigned short cut keyboard audio sound

# Then shapes will begin to be generated starting with the Circle shape. After each shape is drawn an audio sound will be autogenerated on shape completion

# At the end of the last shape drawn, click on the canvas drawing screen to close the window
