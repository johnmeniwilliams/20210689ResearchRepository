In my example, objective is to use Python and tkinter to provide a GIU interface for user to enter data in the form.

Right click "PythonGUI.py" file and choose "Open with...." - "Python"

# five input fields that prompts users
# Enter user Full Name
# Enter Street Address
# Enter Suburb
# Enter City
# Enter Email

# On the form their is a "submit", "reset" and "close" button

# Once input on the form has been completed click the Submit button and the GUI form will reset
# Continue to enter more records as required
# Note that when the user clicks the "submit" button, their information is written/appended to a text file at "e:/coursequery.txt"

# The "Close" button closes the application
